# dropDEAD
A small program to download and tag Grateful Dead shows and other artists from Internet Archive.

Requires internetarchive, mutagen and PySimpleGUI.

I made this to help myself learn Python,and it does what I had hoped I could make it do. It will download and tag any Dead show (and shows from 
about 20 other bands) from Internet Archive in Flac or MP3 (Dead soundboards are MP3 only by request of the band) and write some tags from the metadata.
